# Welcome {.unnumbered}

In this book we'll cover the  [`tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/) framework, which is a collection of packages for modeling and machine learning using [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) principles to build regression and classification models. Furthermore, we follow the data science lifecycle process proposed by @Wirth2000:


```{r crisp1, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 3, fig.cap = "Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (@Wirth2000)"}

knitr::include_graphics("css/CRISP-DM.png")

```

To learn more about this framework, review this [presentation about the CRISP-DM](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y_6d-yv0Wq9WQvWkYS64KYkcSoswewm-7t2jfSz3aT4/edit?usp=sharing).
