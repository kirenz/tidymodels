In this tutorial we'll specify multiple regression models (Lasso, Random Forest and XGBoost) with different `tidymodels` packages. Furthermore, we follow the data science lifecycle process proposed in the "cross industry standard process for data mining" (CRISP-DM). To learn more about CRISP-DM, review this [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y_6d-yv0Wq9WQvWkYS64KYkcSoswewm-7t2jfSz3aT4/edit?usp=sharing).

In essence, we cover the following steps:


**Business understanding**

1. Describe your goal

1. Frame the problem


**Data understanding**

1. Get an overview of your data structure

1. Split the data into `training data` and `test data`. 

1. Perform data exploration on a copy of the training data. 


**Data preparation**

1. Create data preprocessing recipes for:
 * Feature selection
 * Feature engineering

1. Create a `validation set` (e.g., with k-fold crossvalidation) 


**Modeling**

1. Specify the models

1. Bundle data preprocessing recipe and model in a workflow 

1. Compare model performance on the `validation set` 

1. Pick the model that does best on the `validation set`

1. Train your best model with all of the `training data`

1. Double-check that model against the `test set`.



# Business understanding


:::note
In business understanding, you:

- Define your (business) goal
- Frame the problem (regression, classification,...)
- Choose a performance measure
- Show the data processing components
:::

First of all, we take a look at the big picture and define the objective of our data science project in business terms.

In our example, the goal is to build a model of housing prices in California. In particular, the model should learn from California census data and be able to predict the median house price in any district (population of 600 to 3000 people), given some predictor variables. Hence, we face a supervised learning situation and use a regression model to predict the numerical outcomes. Furthermore, we use the root mean square error (RMSE) as a performance measure for our regression problem.

Let's assume that the model’s output (a prediction of a district’s median housing price) will be fed to another analytics system, along with other data. This downstream system will determine whether it is worth investing in a given area or not. The data processing components (also called pipeline) are shown in \@ref(fig:datapipeline) (I used [Google's architectural templates](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vjm5YdmOH5LrubFhHf1vlqW2O9Z2UqdWA8biN3e8K5U/edit#slide=id.g19b41f69d7_2_265) to draw the pipeline).

# Data understanding

:::note
In Data Understanding, you:

- Import data 
- Get an overview about the data
- Clean data
- Format data properly
- Split data into training and test set using stratified sampling
- Discover and visualize the data to gain insights 
:::

## Imort Data

First of all, let's import the data:

```{r}

LINK <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirenz/datasets/master/housing_unclean.csv"
housing_df <- read_csv(LINK)

```

## Data overview

### Clean data

Take a look at the top 4 rows of the DataFrame: 

```{r}

head(housing_df, 4)

```

Notice the values in the first row of the variables `housing_median_age`and `median_house_value`. We need to remove the strings "years" and "$". Therefore, we use the function `str_remove_all` from the `stringr` package. Since there could be multiple wrong entries of the same type, we apply our corrections to all of the rows of the corresponding variable:

```{r}

housing_df <- 
  housing_df %>% 
  mutate(
    housing_median_age = str_remove_all(housing_median_age, "[years]"),
    median_house_value = str_remove_all(median_house_value, "[$]")
  )

```

### Format data

Next, we take a look at the data structure and check wether all data formats are correct:

* Numeric variables should be in format as integers (`int`) or double precision (`dbl`)

* Categorical (nominal and ordinal) variables should usually be formatted as factors (`fct`) and not characters (`chr`). Especially, if they don't have many levels.

```{r}

glimpse(housing_df)

```

The package `visdat` helps explore the data class structure visually:

```{r}

vis_dat(housing_df)

```

We see that the numeric variables `housing_media_age` and `median_house_value` are declared as `chr` instead of `dbl`.

Furthermore, the categorical variable `ocean_proximity` is formatted as character instead of factor. Let's take a look at the levels of the variable: 

```{r}

housing_df %>% 
  count(ocean_proximity,
        sort = TRUE)

```

The variable has only 5 levels and therefore should be formatted as a factor.

Note that it is usually a good idea to first take care of the numerical variables. Afterwards, we can easily convert all remaining character variables to factors using the function `across` from the dplyr package.

```{r}

# convert to numeric
housing_df <- 
  housing_df %>% 
  mutate(
    housing_median_age = as.numeric(housing_median_age),
    median_house_value = as.numeric(median_house_value)
  )

# convert all remaining character variables to factors 
housing_df <- 
  housing_df %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor))

```

Again, take a look at the data structure:

```{r}

glimpse(housing_df)

```

### Missing data

Now let's turn our attention to missing data. Missing data can be viewed with the function `vis_miss` from the package `visdat`. We arrange the data by columns with most missingness: 

```{r}

vis_miss(housing_df, sort_miss = TRUE)

```

Here an alternative method to obtain missing data: 

```{r}

is.na(housing_df) %>% colSums()

```

We have a missing rate of 0.1% (207 cases) in our variable `total_bedroms`. This can cause problems for some algorithms. We will take care of this issue during our data preparation. 


## Data splitting

Before we get started with data exploration, let’s split our single dataset into two: a training set and a testing set. 

We’ll keep most of the rows in the original dataset in the training set. The training data will be used to fit models, and the testing set will be used to measure model performance.

In our data split, we want to ensure that the training and test set is representative of the various categories of median house values in the whole dataset. Take a look at \@ref(fig:hist-med-value)


```{r hist-med-value, fig.cap="Histogram of Median Proces", out.width='80%'}

housing_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(median_house_value)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 4) 

```


In general, we would like to have instances for each *stratum*, or else the estimate of a stratum's importance may be biased. A *stratum* (plural strata) refers to a subset (part) of the population (entire collection of items under consideration) which is being sampled. You should not have too many strata, and each stratum should be large enough. We use 4 strata in our example. 

To actually split the data, we can use the `rsample` package (included in `tidymodels`) to create an object that contains the information on how to split the data (which we call `data_split`), and then two more `rsample` functions to create data frames for the training and testing sets:

```{r}

# Fix the random numbers by setting the seed 
# This enables the analysis to be reproducible 
set.seed(123)

# Put 3/4 of the data into the training set 
data_split <- initial_split(housing_df, 
                           prop = 3/4, 
                           strata = median_house_value, 
                           breaks = 4)

# Create dataframes for the two sets:
train_data <- training(data_split) 
test_data <- testing(data_split)

```


## Data exploration

The point of data exploration is to gain insights that will help you select important variables for your model and to get ideas for feature engineering in the data preparation phase, where we prepare the data for learning algorithms. Ususally, data exploration is an iterative process: once you get a prototype model up and running, you can analyze its output to gain more insights and come back to this exploration step. Note that we perform data exploration only with our training data.

### Create data copy 

We first make a copy of the training data since we don't want to alter our data during data exploration. 

```{r}

data_explore <- train_data

```

### Create new variables 

One very important thing you may want to do at the beginning is to try out some new variable combinations. For example:

* the *total number of rooms* in a district is not very useful if you don’t know how many households there are. What you really want is the *number of rooms per household*. 

* Similarly, the total number of bedrooms by itself is not very useful: you probably want to compare it to the number of rooms. 

* And the *population per household* also seems like an interesting attribute combination to look at. 

Let’s create these new attributes before we begin with our data exploration:

```{r}

data_explore <- 
  data_explore %>% 
  mutate(rooms_per_household = total_rooms/households,
        bedrooms_per_room = total_bedrooms/total_rooms,
        population_per_household = population/households)

```

### Descriptive statistics 

We obtain a data summary of numerical and categorical attributes using a function from the package `skimr`:

```{r}

skim(data_explore)

```

### Data exploration

#### Map

Since our data includes information about longitude and latitude, we start our visual data exploration with the creation of a geographical  scatterplot of the data to get some first insights: 

```{r point-long-lat, fig.cap="Scatterplot of longitude and latitude", out.width='80%'}

train_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude)) +
  geom_point(color = "cornflowerblue")

```

A better visualization that highlights high-density areas:

```{r point-long-lat-a, fig.cap="Scatterplot of longitude and latitude that highlights high-density areas", out.width='80%'}

train_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude)) +
  geom_point(color = "cornflowerblue", alpha = 0.1) 
  
```

Overview about California housing prices: 

- red is expensive, 
- purple is cheap and 
- larger circles indicate areas with a larger population.


```{r plot-ca-prices, fig.cap="California housing_df prices", out.width='80%'}

train_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = population, color = median_house_value), 
             alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_colour_gradientn(colours=rev(rainbow(4)))

```

Lastly, we add a map to our data:

```{r}
library(ggmap)

qmplot(x = longitude, 
       y = latitude, 
       data = train_data, 
       geom = "point", 
       color = median_house_value, 
       size = population,
       alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_colour_gradientn(colours=rev(rainbow(4)))

```

#### Variable relationships

Next, we take a look at the relationships between our variables. In particular, we are interested in the relationships between our dependent variable `median_house_value` and all other variables. The gooal is to identify possible predictors which we could use in our models to predict the `median_house_value`.  


We start our data exploration with a boxplot of our dependent variable to check, if we find differences in the median house value for the different levels of the categorical variable `ocean_proximity`. Additionally, we use the package `ggsignif` to calculate the significance of a difference between two of our groups and add the annotation to the plot in a single line.   

```{r}
library(ggsignif)

data_explore %>% 
  ggplot(aes(ocean_proximity, median_house_value)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill="#69b3a2") +
  xlab("Ocean proximity") +
  ylab("Median house value") +
  geom_signif(comparisons = list(c("<1H OCEAN", "INLAND")), 
               map_signif_level=TRUE) 
  
```

We can observe a difference in the median house value for the different levels of our categorical variable (except between NEAR BAY and NEAR OCEAN) why we should include this variable in our model. Furthermore, the difference between "<1H OCEAN" and "INLAND" is statistically significant.

Now let's analyze the numerical variables: The function `ggscatmat` from the package `GGally` creates a matrix with scatterplots, densities and correlations for numeric columns. In our code, we enter the dataset `housing_df`, choose columns 8 to 12, a color column for our categorical variable `ocean_proximity`, and an alpha level of 0.8 (for transparency).

```{r }

data_explore %>% 
ggscatmat(columns = 1:12, color="ocean_proximity", alpha=0.8)

```


To plot only correlations of our numerical data, we can use `vis_cor`. We first use Pearson's correlation coefficient:

```{r}

data_explore %>% 
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>% # only select numerical data
  vis_cor(cor_method = "pearson", na_action = "pairwise.complete.obs")

```


Compare the values with Spearman's correlation coefficient:

```{r}

data_explore %>% 
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>% 
  vis_cor(cor_method = "spearman", na_action = "pairwise.complete.obs")

```

Now we take a closer look at the correlation coefficients with the package `corrr`. 

```{r}

library(corrr)

# calculate all correlations
cor_res <- 
  data_explore %>%
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>% 
  correlate(method = "spearman",
            use = "pairwise.complete.obs") 

# show correlations
cor_res %>% 
  select(term, median_house_value) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(median_house_value)) %>% # focus on dependent variable 
  arrange(median_house_value) %>% # sort values
  fashion() # print tidy correlations
  
```

We could also use the function `cor.test()` to calculate the statistical significance of Spearman's rank correlations between the variables. As an example, we calculate the p-value for `median_house_value` and `population_per_household`:

```{r}

cor.test(data_explore$median_house_value, data_explore$population_per_household, method = "spearman")
```

The function `network_plot` outputs a network plot of a correlation data frame in which variables that are more highly correlated appear closer together and are joined by stronger paths. Paths are also colored by their sign (blue for positive and red for negative). The proximity of the points are determined using multidimensional clustering:

```{r}

data_explore %>%
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>%  
  correlate() %>% 
  network_plot(min_cor = .15)

```


Summary of our findings for the numerical variables: 

* `median_income` has a strong positive correlation with median house value.

* the new `bedrooms_per_room` attribute is more correlated (negatively) with the median house value than the total number of rooms or bedrooms. Apparently houses with a lower bedroom/room ratio tend to be more expensive. 

* `rooms_per_household` is also a bit more informative than the total number of rooms in a district —obviously the larger the houses, the more expensive they are.

* `population_per_household` is also correlated with our dependent variable.

Consequently we will use this four numerical variables as well as `ocean_proximity` as predictors in our model.

# Data preparation


:::note
Data preparation:

- Handle missing values
- Fix or remove outliers  
- Feature selection
- Feature engineering
- Feature scaling
- Create a validation set
:::


Next, we’ll preprocess our data before training models. Therefore, we mainly use the tidymodels packages `recipes` and `workflows`. 

`Recipes` are built as a series of optional data preparation steps, such as:

* *Data cleaning*: Fix or remove outliers, fill in missing values (e.g., with zero, mean, median…) or drop their rows (or columns).

* *Feature selection*: Drop the attributes that provide no useful information for the task.

* *Feature engineering*: Discretize continuous features, decompose features (e.g., categorical, date/time, etc.), add promising transformations of features (e.g., log(x), sqrt(x), x2 , etc.) or
aggregate features into promising new features.

* *Feature scaling*: Standardize or normalize features.

We will want to use our recipe across several steps as we train and test our models. To simplify this process, we can use a *model workflow*, which pairs a model and recipe together. 

## Data preparation

Before we create our `recipes`, we first add our new variables and only select the variables which  we will use in the model. Note that we keep `longitude` and `latitude` to be able to map the data in a later stage. 

```{r}

housing_df_new <-
  housing_df %>% 
   mutate(
     rooms_per_household = total_rooms/households,
     bedrooms_per_room = total_bedrooms/total_rooms,
     population_per_household = population/households) %>% 
  select(
    longitude, latitude, median_house_value, 
    median_income, ocean_proximity, 
    bedrooms_per_room, rooms_per_household, population_per_household
         )

glimpse(housing_df_new)


```

Furthermore, we need to make a new data split since we changed the data. 

```{r}
set.seed(123)

# Put 3/4 of the data into the training set 
data_split <- initial_split(housing_df_new, 
                           prop = 3/4, 
                           strata = median_house_value, 
                           breaks = 4)

# Create dataframes for the two sets:
train_data <- training(data_split) 
test_data <- testing(data_split)

```

## Data prepropecessing recipe 

In general, the type of data preprocessing is dependent on the type of model being fit. The excellent book "Tidy Modeling with R" provides an [appendix with recommendations for baseline levels of preprocessing](https://www.tmwr.org/pre-proc-table.html) that are needed for various model functions. 

Let’s create a base `recipe` for all of our regression models (lasso, natural spline, random forest, XGBoost, k-nearest neighbor):

* The `recipe()` function has two arguments: 
 * *A formula*. Any variable on the left-hand side of the tilde (`~`) is considered the model outcome (here, `median_house_value`). On the right-hand side of the tilde are the predictors. Variables may be listed by name (separated by a `+`), or you can use the dot (`.`) to indicate all other variables as predictors. 
 * *The data*. A recipe is associated with the data set used to create the model. This will typically be the training set, so `data = train_data` here. 


* `update_role()`: This step of adding roles to a recipe is optional; the purpose of using it here is that those two variables can be retained in the data but not included in the model. This can be convenient when, after the model is fit, we want to investigate some poorly predicted value. These ID columns will be available and can be used to try to understand what went wrong. 

* `step_naomit()` removes observations (rows of data) if they contain NA or NaN values. We use `skip = TRUE` because we don't want to perform this part to new data so that the number of samples in the assessment set is the same as the number of predicted values (even if they are NA).

* `step_novel()` converts all nominal variables to factors and takes care of other issues related to categorical variables.

* `step_dummy()` converts the factor columns into (one or more) numeric binary (0 and 1) variables.

* `step_zv()`: removes any numeric variables that have zero variance.

* `step_corr()`: will remove predictor variables that have large correlations with other predictor variables.


```{r}

housing_rec <-
  recipe(median_house_value ~ .,
         data = train_data) %>%
  update_role(longitude, latitude, 
              new_role = "ID") %>% 
  step_mutate(
    
    ) %>% 
  step_naomit(everything(), skip = TRUE) %>% 
  step_novel(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal()) %>%
  step_zv(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes()) %>%
  step_corr(all_predictors(), threshold = 0.7, method = "spearman") 

```


To view the current set of variables and roles, use the `summary()` function:

```{r}

summary(housing_rec)

```


## Validation set

Remember that we already partitioned our data set into a training set and test set. This lets us judge whether a given model will generalize well to new data. However, using only two partitions may be insufficient when doing many rounds of hyperparameter tuning (which we don't perform in this tutorial). Therefore, it is usually a good idea to create a so called `validation set`. Watch this short [video from Google's Machine Learning crash course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/validation/video-lecture) to learn more about the value of a validation set.  

We use k-fold crossvalidation to build a set of 5 validation folds with the function `vfold_cv` (we also use stratified sampling in this example):

```{r}

set.seed(100)

cv_folds <-
 vfold_cv(train_data, 
          v = 5, # number of folds
          strata = median_house_value,
          breaks = 4) 

```

We will come back to the validation set after we specified our models. 

# Model building

## Specify models

The process of specifying our models is always as follows:

1. Pick a `model type` 
2. set the `engine`
3. Set the `mode`: regression or classification

You can choose the `model type` and `engine` from this [list](https://www.tidymodels.org/find/parsnip/)

### Lasso regression 

```{r}

lasso_spec <- # your model specification
  linear_reg(penalty = 0.1, mixture = 1) %>%  # model type
  set_engine(engine = "glmnet") %>%  # model engine
  set_mode("regression") # model mode

# Show your model specification
lasso_spec

```

* `penalty`: The total amount of regularization in the model. Higher values imply a higher penalty. 

* `mixture`: The mixture amounts of different types of regularization. A number between zero and one (inclusive) that is the proportion of L1 regularization (i.e. lasso) in the model. When mixture = 1, it is a pure lasso model while mixture = 0 indicates that ridge regression is being used. (glmnet and spark only).

Note that for the lasso regression to work properly we need to add a data normalization step. We will update our recipe at a later step (when we create the workflows).

### Natural spline  

```{r}

spline_spec <- 
  linear_reg() %>%  
  set_engine(engine = "lm") %>%  
  set_mode("regression")

```

To use this model correctly, we also need to add a data normalization step as well as a step to declare the degree of freedom in our model. We will update our recipe at a later step (when we create the workflows).

### Random forest

```{r}
library(ranger)

rf_spec <- 
  rand_forest() %>% 
  set_engine("ranger") %>% 
  set_mode("regression")

```

### Boosted tree (XGBoost)

```{r}
library(xgboost)

xgb_spec <- 
  boost_tree() %>% 
  set_engine("xgboost") %>% 
  set_mode("regression") 

```

### K-nearest neighbor   

```{r}

knn_spec <- 
  nearest_neighbor() %>% 
  set_engine("kknn") %>% 
  set_mode("regression") 

```



## Create workflows

To combine the data preparation recipe with the model building, we use the package [workflows](https://workflows.tidymodels.org). A workflow is an object that can bundle together your pre-processing recipe, modeling, and even post-processing requests (like calculating the RMSE). 

### Lasso

Note that we first need to normalize (z-standardize) the data for our lasso model. We just update our base recipe and add this step to a new recipe we call `housing_rec_lasso`: 

```{r}

housing_rec_lasso <- # create a new recipe object
  housing_rec %>%  # use the old recipe
  step_normalize(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes()) # add the step_normalize

```

Bundle recipe and model with `workflows`:

```{r}

lasso_wflow <- # new workflow object
 workflow() %>% # use workflow function
 add_recipe(housing_rec_lasso) %>%   # use the new recipe
 add_model(lasso_spec)   # add your model spec

```


### Natural spline

Note that we also first need to normalize (z-standardize) the data for a natural spline model. Furthermore, we need to declare the degrees of freedom (in `step_ns()`). In our example, we use the 

```{r}
library(splines)

housing_rec_spline <- 
  housing_rec %>%  
  step_normalize(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes()) %>% 
  step_ns(all_predictors(), deg_free = 3) # natural spline

```

Bundle recipe and model:

```{r}

spline_wflow <- 
 workflow() %>% 
 add_recipe(housing_rec_spline) %>%   # use the spline recipe
 add_model(spline_spec) 

```


### Random forest

```{r}

rf_wflow <-
 workflow() %>%
 add_recipe(housing_rec) %>% # use the regular recipe
 add_model(rf_spec) 

```


### XGBoost

```{r}

xgb_wflow <-
 workflow() %>%
 add_recipe(housing_rec) %>% 
 add_model(xgb_spec)

```

### K -nearest neighbor

Note that we first need to normalize (z-standardize) the data for our model. 

```{r}

housing_rec_knn <- 
  housing_rec %>%  
  step_normalize(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes()) 

```

Bundle recipe and model:

```{r}

knn_wflow <-
 workflow() %>%
 add_recipe(housing_rec_knn) %>% 
 add_model(xgb_spec)

## Evaluate models

Now we can use our validation set (`cv_folds`) to estimate the performance of our models using the `fit_resamples()` function to fit the models on each of the 5 folds and store the results. 

Note that `fit_resamples()` will fit our model to each resample and evaluate on the heldout set from each resample. The function is usually only used for computing performance metrics across some set of resamples to evaluate our models - the models are not even stored. However, in our example we save the predictions in order to visualize the model fit and residuals with `control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)`.

Finally, we collect the performance metrics with `collect_metrics()` and pick the model that does best on the validation set.

### Lasso regression


```{r}

set.seed(100)

lasso_res <- 
  lasso_wflow %>% # use workflow object
  fit_resamples(resamples = cv_folds,
                control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)
                # to save the predictions in order to visualize 
                # the model fit and residuals
    )

```

Show average performance over all folds:

```{r}

lasso_res %>%  collect_metrics(summarize = TRUE)

```

Show performance for every single fold:

```{r}

lasso_res %>%  collect_metrics(summarize = FALSE)

```

To obtain the assessment set predictions:

```{r}

assess_res <- collect_predictions(lasso_res)

assess_res %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = median_house_value, y = .pred)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .15) +
  geom_abline(col = "red") + 
  coord_obs_pred() + 
  ylab("Predicted")

```

There are two median house values in the training set that are significantly underpredicted by the model. Which districts are that?

```{r}

under_predicted <- 
  assess_res %>% 
  mutate(residual = median_house_value - .pred) %>% 
  arrange(desc(abs(residual))) %>% 
  slice_head(n = 2)

under_predicted

```

Show the two observations in the training data.

```{r}

cases_under_predicted <- 
  train_data %>% 
  dplyr::slice(under_predicted$.row) 

```

Let's find the two districts at the map: 

```{r}

qmplot(x = longitude, 
       y = latitude, 
       data = cases_under_predicted, 
       geom = "point", 
       color = "red",
       zoom = 10) 

```

In this tutorial, we don't further investigate the reasons for the underprediction. In a real projet, we would go back to our original data, eventually remove the two cases and train the model again. 


### Natural spline

Here, we don't repeat all of the steps shown in lasso regression and just focus on the performance metrics.

```{r}

spline_res <-
  spline_wflow %>% 
  fit_resamples(
    resamples = cv_folds,
    control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)
    )

spline_res %>%  collect_metrics(summarize = TRUE)

```

### Random forest


```{r}

rf_res <-
  rf_wflow %>% 
  fit_resamples(
    resamples = cv_folds,
    control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)
    )

rf_res %>%  collect_metrics(summarize = TRUE)

```

### XGBoost

```{r}

xgb_res <- 
  xgb_wflow %>% 
  fit_resamples(
    resamples = cv_folds,
    control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)
    ) 

xgb_res %>% collect_metrics(summarize = TRUE)

```


### K-nearest neighbor

```{r}

knn_res <- 
  knn_wflow %>% 
  fit_resamples(
    resamples = cv_folds,
    control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)
    ) 

knn_res %>% collect_metrics(summarize = TRUE)

```


### Compare models

Extract the RMSE from our models to compare them:

```{r}

lasso_rmse <- 
  lasso_res %>% 
  collect_metrics(summarise = TRUE) %>%
  rename(rmse = mean) %>% 
  mutate(model = "lasso")

spline_rmse <- 
  spline_res %>% 
  collect_metrics(summarise = TRUE) %>%
  rename(rmse = mean) %>% 
  mutate(model = "spline")

rf_rmse <- 
  rf_res %>% 
  collect_metrics(summarise = TRUE) %>%
  rename(rmse = mean) %>% 
  mutate(model = "random forest")

xgb_rmse <- 
  xgb_res %>% 
  collect_metrics(summarise = TRUE) %>%
  rename(rmse = mean) %>% 
  mutate(model = "XGBoost")

knn_rmse <- 
  knn_res %>% 
  collect_metrics(summarise = TRUE) %>%
  rename(rmse = mean) %>% 
  mutate(model = "Knn")

# create dataframe with all models
model_compare <- bind_rows(lasso_rmse,
                           spline_rmse,
                           rf_rmse,
                           xgb_rmse,
                           knn_rmse) 

# show all models
model_compare %>% 
  select(model, .metric, rmse, std_err)

```


```{r}
# find minimum rmse
model_compare %>% 
  filter(.metric== "rmse") %>% 
  select(model, rmse, std_err) %>% 
  slice_min(rmse)
```

Now it's time to fit the best model (in our case the XGBoost model) one last time to the full training set and evaluate the resulting final model on the test set.

# Last fit and evaluation 

Tidymodels provides the function [`last_fit()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/last_fit.html) which fits a model to the training data and evaluates it on the test set. We just need to provide the workflow object of the best model as well as the data split object (not the training data).


```{r}

last_fit_xgb <- last_fit(xgb_wflow, split = data_split)

# Show RMSE and RSQ
last_fit_xgb %>% 
  collect_metrics()

```
And this is our final result.
