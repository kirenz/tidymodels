# (PART) RECIPES {-} 

# Data preprocessing

*The following content is based on the [tidymodels documentation](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/recipes/) and Alisson Hill's [tidymodels workshop](https://alison.rbind.io/tags/tidymodels/).*

In this chapter, we’ll explore the tidymodels package, `recipes`, which is designed to help you preprocess your data before training your model. 

Recipes are built as a series of preprocessing steps, such as:

* converting qualitative predictors to indicator variables (also known as dummy variables),
* transforming data to be on a different scale (e.g., taking the logarithm of a variable),
* transforming whole groups of predictors together,
* extracting key features from raw variables (e.g., getting the day of the week out of a date variable),

and so on. If you are familiar with R’s formula interface, a lot of this might sound familiar and like what a formula already does. Recipes can be used to do many of the same things, but they have a much wider range of possibilities. This article shows how to use recipes for modeling.

In summary, the idea of the [recipes package](https://recipes.tidymodels.org) is to define a recipe or blueprint that can be used to sequentially define the encodings and preprocessing of the data (i.e. “feature engineering”) before we build our models.


# Data preparation

Next, we use a `recipe()` to build a set of steps for data preprocessing and feature engineering.

* First, we must tell the `recipe()` what our model is going to be (using a formula here) and what our training data is.
* `step_novel()` will convert all nominal variables to factors.
* We then convert the factor columns into (one or more) numeric binary (0 and 1) variables for the levels of the training data.
* We remove any numeric variables that have zero variance.
* We normalize (center and scale) the numeric variables. 



```{r}

housing_rec <-
  recipe(median_house_value ~ ., data = new_train) %>%
  step_novel(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal()) %>%
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_normalize(all_predictors())

# Show the content of our recipe
housing_rec
  
```


Let's have a closer look at the different components of the recipe.

## recipe()

First of all, we created a simple recipe (we call it `rec`) containing only an outcome (`median_house_value`) and predictors (all other variables in the dataset: `.`). To demonstrate the use of recipes step by step, we create a new object with the name `rec`:

```{r }

rec <- recipe(median_house_value ~ ., data = new_train)

```

The formula `median_house_value ~ .` indicates outcomes vs predictors.

## Helper functions

Here some helper functions for selecting sets of variables:

* `all_predictors()`: Each x variable (right side of ~)
* `all_outcomes()`: Each y variable (left side of ~)
* `all_numeric()`: Each numeric variable
* `all_nominal()`: Each categorical variable (e.g. factor, string)
* `dplyr::select()` helpers starts_with('Lot_'), etc.


## step_novel()

[`step_novel()`](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/reference/step_novel.html) will convert all nominal variables to factors. It adds a catch-all level to a factor for any new values, which lets R intelligently predict new levels in the test set. Missing values will remain missing.

```{r}

rec %>%
  step_novel(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes())

```

## step_dummy()

Converts nominal data into dummy variables.

```{r}

rec %>%
 step_dummy(all_nominal())

```


## step_zv()

`step_zv()` removes zero variance variables (variables that contain only a single value). 

```{r}

rec %>%
  step_zv(all_predictors())

```

When the recipe is applied to the data set, a column could contain only zeros. This is a "*zero-variance predictor*" that has no information within the column. While some R functions will not produce an error for such predictors, it usually causes warnings and other issues. `step_zv()` will remove columns from the data when the training set data have a single value- This step should be added to the recipe after `step_dummy()`.

## step_normalize()

Centers then scales numeric variable (mean = 0, sd = 1)

```{r}

rec %>%
  step_normalize(all_numeric())

```

Now it's time to **specify** and then **fit** our models. 







# Model building

To combine the data preparation with the model building, we use the package [workflows](https://workflows.tidymodels.org). 

A workflow is an object that can bundle together your pre-processing, modeling, and post-processing requests. 

## Specify model

```{r}

lm_spec <- 
  linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lm") %>% 
  set_mode(mode = "regression")

```


## Create workflow


```{r}

lm_wflow <-
 workflow() %>%
 add_model(lm_spec) %>% 
 add_recipe(housing_rec)

```

## Evaluate model

Now we can fit the model and collect the performance metrics with `collect_metrics()`:



```{r}


lm_wflow_eval <- 
  lm_wflow %>% 
  fit_resamples(
    median_house_value ~ ., 
    resamples = cv_folds
    ) 

lm_wflow_eval%>% 
    collect_metrics()

```


# Last fit and evaluation 

Fit the final best model to the training set and evaluate the test set with the function [`last_fit()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/last_fit.html):


```{r}

last_fit_lm <- last_fit(lm_wflow, split = new_split)

# Show RMSE and RSQ
last_fit_lm %>% 
  collect_metrics()

```
