The core content of this introductory data science course focuses on data acquisition and wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, inference, modelling, and effective communication of results. A heavy emphasis is placed on a consistent syntax (with tools from the tidyverse), reproducibility (with R Markdown), and version control and collaboration (with Git and GitHub). The RStudio Cloud workspace for your course is provided in your Moodle-Course. You have to join the workspace to use the sample application exercises.

Specifically we cover fundamentals of data and data visualization, confounding variables, and Simpson’s paradox as well as the concept of tidy data, data import, data cleaning, and data curation. We end the unit with web scraping and introduce the idea of iteration in preparation for the next unit. Also in this unit we introduce the toolkit: R, RStudio, R Markdown, Git, and GitHub. 3.1 Slides, videos, and application exercises 3.1.1 Visualising data Unit 2 - Deck 1: Data and visualisation Slides Source Unit 2 - Deck 2: Visualising data with ggplot2 Slides Source R4DS :: Chp 3 - Data visualization Unit 2 - Deck 3: Visualising numerical data Slides Source IMS :: Sec 2.1 - Exploring numerical data Unit 2 - Deck 4: Visualising categorical data Slides Source IMS :: Sec 2.2 - Exploring categorical data StarWars + Dataviz Source 3.1.2 Wrangling and tidying data Unit 2 - Deck 5: Tidy data Slides Source JSS :: Tidy data Unit 2 - Deck 6: Grammar of data wrangling Slides Source Unit 2 - Deck 7: Working with a single data frame Slides Source R4DS :: Chp 5 - Data transformation Unit 2 - Deck 8: Working with multiple data frames Slides Source R4DS :: Chp 13 - Relational data Unit 2 - Deck 9: Tidying data Slides Source R4DS :: Chp 12 - Tidy data Hotels + Data wrangling Source 3.1.3 Importing and recoding data Unit 2 - Deck 10: Data types Slides Source Unit 2 - Deck 11: Data classes Slides Source R4DS :: Chp 15 - Factors Unit 2 - Deck 12: Importing data Slides Source R4DS :: Chp 11 - Data import Unit 2 - Deck 13: Recoding data Slides R4DS :: Sec 16.1 - 16.3 - Dates and times Hotels + Data types Source Source Nobels + Sales + Data import Source Source 3.1.4 Communicating data science results effectively Unit 2 - Deck 14: Tips for effective data visualization Slides Source IMS :: Sec 2.3 - Effective data visualisation Brexit + Telling stories with dataviz Source Unit 2 - Deck 15: Scientific studies and confounding Slides Source IMS :: Sec 1.3 - Sampling principles and strategies IMS :: Sec 1.4 - Experiments Unit 2 - Deck 16: Simpson’s paradox Slides Source Unit 2 - Deck 17: Doing data science Slides Source R4DS :: Chp 7 - Exploratory data analysis 3.1.5 Web scraping and programming Unit 2 - Deck 18: Web scraping Slides Source Unit 2 - Deck 19: Scraping top 250 movies on IMDB Slides Source Unit 2 - Deck 20: Web scraping considerations Slides Source IMDB + Web scraping Source Unit 2 - Deck 21: Functions Slides Source R4DS :: Chp 19 - Functions Unit 2 - Deck 22: Iteration Slides Source R4DS :: Chp 20 - Iteration 3.2 Labs Lab 1: Hello R Introduction to R, R Markdown, Git, and GitHub Instructions Source Starter Lab 2: Plastic waste Introduction to working with data in R with the tidyverse Instructions Source Starter Lab 3: Nobel laureates Data wrangling and tidying Instructions Source Starter Lab 4: La Quinta is Spanish for ‘next to Denny’s,’ Pt. 1 Visualizing spatial data Instructions Source Starter Lab 5: La Quinta is Spanish for ‘next to Denny’s,’ Pt. 2 Wrangling spatial data Instructions Source Starter Lab 6: Sad plots Critiquing and improving data visualisations Instructions Source Starter Lab 7: Simpson’s paradox Data visualisation, confounding, multivariable relationships Instructions Source Starter Lab 8: University of Edinburgh Art Collection Web scraping, function, iteration Instructions Source Starter 3.3 Homework assignments HW 1: Pet names Introduction to working with data in R with the tidyverse Instructions Source Starter HW 2: Edinburgh Airbnb rentals Data visualisation with the tidyverse Instructions Source Starter HW 3: Road traffic accidents Data wrangling, tidying, and visualization Instructions Source Starter HW 4: What should I major in?

We discuss building, interpreting, and selecting models, visualizing interaction effects, and prediction and model validation. Statistical inference is introduced from a simulation based perspective, and the Central Limit Theorem is discussed very briefly to lay the foundation for future coursework in statistics. 4.1 Slides, videos, and application exercises 4.1.1 Modelling data Unit 4 - Deck 1: The language of models Slides Source Unit 4 - Deck 2: Fitting and interpreting models Slides Source IMS :: Chp 3 - Introduction to linear models Unit 4 - Deck 3: Modelling nonlinear relationships Slides Source Unit 4 - Deck 4: Models with multiple predictors Slides Source IMS :: Sec 4.1 - Regression with multiple predictors Unit 4 - Deck 5: More models with multiple predictors Slides Source 4.1.2 Classification and model building Unit 4 - Deck 6: Logistic regression Slides Source IMS :: Sec 4.5 - Logistic regression Unit 4 - Deck 7: Prediction and overfitting Slides Source tidymodels :: Build a model Unit 4 - Deck 8: Feature engineering Slides Source tidymodels :: Preprocess your data with recipes 4.1.3 Model validation Unit 4 - Deck 9: Cross validation Slides Source tidymodels :: Evaluate your model with resampling The Office + Feature engineering, Pt. 1 Source The Office + Cross validation, Pt. 2 Source 4.1.4 Uncertainty quantification Unit 4 - Deck 10: Quantifying uncertainty Slides Source Unit 4 - Deck 11: Bootstrapping Slides Source IMS :: Sec 5.2 - Bootstrap confidence intervals Unit 4 - Deck 12: Hypothesis testing Slides Source IMS :: Sec 5.1 - Randomization tests Unit 4 - Deck 13: Inference overview Slides Source 4.2 Labs Lab 10: Grading the professor, Pt. 1 Fitting and interpreting simple linear regression models Instructions Source Starter Lab 11: Grading the professor, Pt. 2 Fitting and interpreting multiple linear regression models Instructions Source Starter Lab 12: Smoking while pregnant Constructing confidence intervals, conducting hypothesis tests, and interpreting results in context of the data Instructions Source Starter 4.3 Homework assignments HW 7: Bike rentals in DC Exploratory data analysis and fitting and interpreting models Instructions Source Starter HW 8: Exploring the GSS Fitting and interpreting models Instructions Source Starter HW 9: Modelling the GSS Model validation and inference Instructions Source Starter "],["interactive-tutorials.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive tutorials", " Chapter 5 Interactive tutorials The following interactive tutorials have been built with learnr and gradethis. They’re available on shinyapps.io (linked) as well as distributed with the dsbox package.1 With the dsbox package installed, you can also run these tutorials in the Tutorials pane of your RStudio window. Tutorial 1: Airbnb listings in Edinburgh The goal of this tutorial is not to conduct a thorough analysis of Airbnb listings in Edinburgh, but instead to give you a chance to practice your data visualisation and interpretation skills. [Tutorial] [Source] Tutorial 2: Road Traffic Accidents Continue practising data visualization skills with ggplot2. Filter data for certain attributes with filter(). Create new variables based on existing variables in the data with mutate(). [Tutorial] [Source] Tutorial 3: What should I major in? Continue practising data tidying and visualisation. Calculate summary statistics with summarise(). Arrange output of dplyr chains with arrange(). [Tutorial] [Source] Tutorial 4: Lego sales Practice the analysis skills you have learned so far. Develop a question you can answer with the data. Deepen your understanding of building and interpreting visualisations. [Tutorial] [Source] Tutorial 5: Money in US politics Get started with scraping data from the web. Continue to build on your data cleaning and visualisation skills. [Tutorial] [Source] Tutorial 6: Bike Rentals in D.C. Continue to hone your data wrangling skills. Practice modelling and interpreting model results and performance. Conduct backwards selection for finding the “best” model. [Tutorial] [Source] Tutorial 7: Exploring the General Social Survey Work on your data manipulation skills. Fit linear models with multiple predictors. Interpret regression output. [Tutorial] [Source] Tutorial 8: Bootstrapping the General Social Survey Continue to hone your data wrangling skills. Use bootstrapping to construct confidence intervals. Interpret of confidence intervals in context of the data.
